# Guess-word-gallows

Guess-word-gallows is a React (TypeScript) app that revives the classic word-guessing game with a modern touch. Players guess a hidden word one letter at a time, with incorrect guesses tracked in a hangman-style display. Leveraging TypeScript and React, this project showcases my skills in combining game logic with interactive web technologies for a smooth user experience.
